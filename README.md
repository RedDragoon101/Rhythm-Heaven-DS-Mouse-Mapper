SETUP:
1. place your legally obtained Rhythm Heaven DS Rom into the folder that contains the Python Script and the MelonDS.exe
2. Open Remap my buttons.py
3. Choose which buttons on your controller control which action in game:

Here is a list of what each action is and what its used for:
   
Quick Tap:
This is a very quick tap of the screen, used for Moai Doo Wop's quick taps
   
Hold:
This will hold the mouse button down as long as you hold the button down. Releases when the button is let go of
   
Flick:
When held, this button will do the same as the Hold action, however, when released, the mouse will flick up before letting go. This can be done out of a Hold Action.
   
Shake:
This will simply move the cursor up when held and move it down when not held. This is used for Love Lizards and Love Lab. So think about putting it on a button you can easily hit the Flick or the Hold with.
   
Skip:
When pressed, will quickly press the position of the skip button in tutorials, then return to where the mouse was.
   
Up, Down, Left, Right:
These should be put on the stick or d-pad and is used to move in the menus.
   
5. Open Rhythm Heaven DS.py
6. Thats it! The game (should) be in the right orientation by default and at the right size.
    If its not, go into the settings and make it rotated by 270 degrees and Windowed Fullscreen. This is so the script can properly touch the right places. If you want, you can increase the graphics in the settings to fit your computers specs.

    Hope you enjoy my hard labor.
